My CS 598 MS Project:

Movie Library

Android app that includes the ability to scan movie bar codes to get information from the web such as title, genre and other information. The app will also store this information and allow you to search for a move by title, genre or the other information retrieved. The app will allow you to rate the movies based on personal liking. The search results can be sorted by date of release, addition, title, rating, etc; or some combination of those. The app could also support a wishlist type of functionality. For instance you are in a store and found a movie that you would like to eventually purchase or have someone else purchase for you. You can scan the bar code and add it to a wishlist that you can then share via text, Multimedia , e-mail or an app listed below.
